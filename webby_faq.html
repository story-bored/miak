            <!-- faq answer -->

                <p>As you may know; Dr. Richard Thomas Quinn brought Webby to light with hopes of creating the next leap in technological advancements; an “interactive-best friend” that fits in your hand. Webby was designed with everyone in mind; from small children looking for a friend, to students in need of a tutor, to busy workers in need of a personal assistant. The idea was slowly abandoned in favor of the “ZPhone”, which rose to popularity during it’s first release in 2007. Quinn then sold Webby to be repurposed as the anti virus site you know her as today. </p>
